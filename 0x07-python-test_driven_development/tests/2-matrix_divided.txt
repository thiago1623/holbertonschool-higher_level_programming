================================================================================
test for my program
================================================================================
this program Write a function that divides all elements
of a matrix.
Here we show the possible cases
================================================================================
>>> matrix_divided = __import__('2-matrix_divided').matrix_divided

Correct Usage:
>>> matrix = [[1, 2, 3],[4, 5, 6]]
>>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 3))
[[0.33, 0.67, 1.0], [1.33, 1.67, 2.0]]
>>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 5))
[[0.2, 0.4, 0.6], [0.8, 1.0, 1.2]]
>>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 10))
[[0.1, 0.2, 0.3], [0.4, 0.5, 0.6]]


On Errors:
>>> matrix = [["s","s","s"],["a","a","a"]]
>>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 3))
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
